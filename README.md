# Design
## Color Scheme
- The main colors i used were pink, yellow and light blue for the Font Awesome icons. I chose these "Pastel" inspired colours because i knew they would look nice with a text-shadow effect when hovered over them.

## Fonts
- The primary font used was Fuzzy Bubbles with a fallback of Garamond in case the fonnt isn't imported into the site correctly. Fuzzy Bubbles is an attractive, fun font.

## Imagery
- I chose to use font awesome icons instead of images in this site as i feel like icons are more suited to the nature of this game.
