# Design
## Color Scheme
- The main colors i used were pink, yellow and light blue for the Font Awesome icons. I chose these "Pastel" inspired colours because i knew they would look nice with a text-shadow effect when hovered over them.

## Fonts
- The primary font used was Fuzzy Bubbles with a fallback of Garamond in case the fonnt isn't imported into the site correctly. Fuzzy Bubbles is an attractive, fun font.

## Imagery
- I chose to use font awesome icons instead of images in this site as i feel like icons are more suited to the nature of this game.

## Has interactive features
### Landing Page
-   Username is required to be able to use the Lets play button.
-   The Lets play button has a hover feature where it inverts its colours.
### Game Page
-   The colorful Rock, Paper and scissors icons on the bottom of the page have a hover effect which will display them as glowing neon icons. I found this great tutorial on [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/how-to-create-neon-text-with-css/) 
-   The scoreboard updates live to the current score of the game as you play.
-   When rock paper or scissors is selected, you get feedback on what the computer/robot has selected too. This happens in two form, the robots selected icon will light up for 2 seconds and turn off again. There will be a little written description of what you picked and what the robot picked and the result of that round.
- There is a home button on the top left corner of the header to take you back to the landing page. This also lightly glows as you hover over it staying consistent with the rest of the site.
- I have a fun cursor follower animation for the game page. It adds to the "game feel". I found this cool animation on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/morphed/pen/LZWppE).
