# User Experience (UX)
- First time visitor Goals
    - As a first time visitor, I want to instantly understand the purpose of the site.
    - As a first time visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate through the site.
    - As a first time visitor, I want the game to be fun.

- Returning / Frequent user goals
    - As a returning / frequent user, I want to be able to come back and play again.

## Target Audience
Rock Paper Scissors is a classic game and this site is made for everyone, to have fun!

## The features i wanted my project to have are

- Create a username
- Scoretracking system
- Provide feedback to the user after input
- Provide feedback on the result of the game
- Easy to navigate
- Feel fun to be on the site through colour and interactivity

# Design
## Color Scheme
- The main colors i used were pink, yellow and light blue for the Font Awesome icons. I chose these "Pastel" inspired colours because i knew they would look nice with a text-shadow ( Neon) effect when hovered over them. I used Coolers to help me to generate this color pallette.

## Fonts
- The primary font used was Fuzzy Bubbles with a fallback of Garamond in case the fonnt isn't imported into the site correctly. Fuzzy Bubbles is an attractive, fun font.

## Imagery
- I chose to use font awesome icons instead of images in this site as i feel like icons are more suited to the nature of this game.

## Has interactive features
### Landing Page
-   Username is required to be able to use the Lets play button.
-   The Lets play button has a hover feature where it inverts its colours.
### Game Page
-   The colorful Rock, Paper and scissors icons on the bottom of the page have a hover effect which will display them as glowing neon icons. I found this great tutorial on [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/how-to-create-neon-text-with-css/) 
-   The scoreboard updates live to the current score of the game as you play.
-   When rock paper or scissors is selected, you get feedback on what the computer/robot has selected too. This happens in two form, the robots selected icon will light up for 2 seconds and turn off again. There will be a little written description of what you picked and what the robot picked and the result of that round.
- There is a home button on the top left corner of the header to take you back to the landing page. This also lightly glows as you hover over it staying consistent with the rest of the site.
- I have a fun cursor follower animation for the game page. It adds to the "game feel". I found this cool animation on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/morphed/pen/LZWppE).

# Further Testing

- I have tested the website on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari and Edge.
- I have tested to make sure the websites navigation is working correctly.
- The website was tested on Iphone 8, X and 11 pro, Ipad, Macbook Air and Desktop by me.
- I sent the site link to friends and asked them to test it out and play the game so they could let me know any issues they encountered, how the game felt to play and if navigation and ease of use was all okay.

# Testing the User Stories from the User Experience (UX) Section
## First Time Visitor Goals
1. As a first time visitor, I want to instantly understand the purpose of the site.
    - When first entering the site you instantly know that its a game by the big Lets PLay button. You are given instructions on how to play the game and you are made familiar with the game icons.

2. As a first time visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate through the site.
    - The site is easily navigated through. If a user presses the lets play button without entering a username they are subtly prompted to do so my means of adding a red margin around the username box. 
    - When on the game page, if a user would like to return to the landing page to change their username, there is a Home icon on the top left corner of the screen.

3. As a first time visitor, I want the game to be fun.
    - I think there is a nostalgic feel to this game for everyone. It's not a strategic game but a game of chance, so you never know that the result is going to be! It is a fun game to play. Even to move your mouse around and hover over the icons is fun.

## Returning / Frequent User Goals

2. As a returning / frequent user, I want to be able to come back and play again.
    - This is an easy one to acheive as the site is live. I think for the returning user in the future there could be added levels of difficulty to the game.
